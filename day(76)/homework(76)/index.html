      <p class="child1-p2">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so,
      in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>

      <p class="child1-p3">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a<br>
      transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
      for<br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
      The next 12,<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
      the course, I’ve<br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <p class="child2-p1">Verified Graduate</p>

      <p class="child2-p2">The team was very<br> supportive and kept me<br> motivated</p>

      <p class="child2-p3">“ I started as a total newbie with<br> virtually no coding skills. I now work<br> as a mobile engineer 
      for a big<br> company. This was one of the best<br> investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

      <p class="child3-p2">Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</p>
      <p class="child3-p3">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed<br> some structure from 
      professionals<br> who can help me learn programming<br> step by step. I was encouraged<br> to enroll by a former 
      student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things<br> about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
      did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for<br> assistance. The agile team 
      project, in<br> particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way<br> that no tutorial 
      could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my<br> developent 
      experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 
      100% recommend! ”</p>

      <p class="child4-p2">An overall wonderful<br> and rewarding<br> experience</p>

      <p class="child4-p3">“ Thank you for the wonderful<br> experience! I now have a job I really<br> enjoy, and make a good living

      <p class="child5-p2">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br> themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
      learning from<br> their experiences was easy</p>.

      <p class="child5-p3">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The<br> program 
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br> myself as a capable 
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from 
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
